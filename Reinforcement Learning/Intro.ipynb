    "# 🧠 Reinforcement Learning (RL) - Simplified Guide\n",
    "\n",
    "Reinforcement Learning is a type of **Machine Learning** where an agent **learns by interacting** with an environment, taking actions, and **receiving feedback** in the form of rewards.\n",

    "## 🏟️ Real-life Analogy\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine training a **dog**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* You say **\"Sit\"**\n",
    "* If the dog sits, you give a **treat** (reward)\n",
    "* If not, no treat\n",
    "\n",
    "Over time, the dog learns to sit when you say “sit” to **maximize rewards**.\n",

    "1. Agent observes current state (S)\n",

    "1. **Agent** starts in a certain **state** `S`\n",
    "2. It selects an **action** `A` based on its **policy** (strategy)\n",
    "3. The **environment** receives this action and responds with:\n",
    "   - A **new state** `S'` (what happens next)\n",
    "   - A **reward** `R` (positive or negative feedback)\n",
    "4. The **agent** uses this feedback to **learn** and improve its policy.\n",
    "5. Repeat this process → **learn better actions over time**.\n",
