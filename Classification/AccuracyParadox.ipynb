    "\n",
    "The **Accuracy Paradox** occurs when a classification model has **high accuracy**, but it is actually **misleading** and performs **poorly** on the real problem.\n",

    "\n",
    "## 🤔 Why Does It Happen?\n",
    "\n",
    "Because **accuracy** is the ratio of correct predictions to total predictions:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Accuracy = (Correct Predictions) / (Total Predictions)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "It **doesn't consider** class imbalance (when one class dominates the dataset).\n",

    "Suppose you're building a model to detect a **rare disease**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Dataset:\n",
    "  - 990 healthy people\n",
    "  - 10 people with the disease\n",
    "\n",
    "If your model **predicts everyone is healthy**, you'll get:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ✅ Correct predictions: 990 (healthy)\n",
    "- ❌ Missed disease cases: 10\n",
    "- 🎯 Accuracy = 990 / 1000 = **99%**\n",
    "\n",
    "BUT: It missed **all** disease cases = **useless model!**\n",
