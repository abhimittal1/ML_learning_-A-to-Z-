    "## üß† What is UCB?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Upper Confidence Bound (UCB)** is a strategy for choosing which arm (option) to pull in a Multi-Armed Bandit problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is to **pick the arm that could be the best**, not just based on past results but also by **how uncertain** we are about it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚öñÔ∏è Core Principle: \"Optimism in the face of uncertainty\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of just picking the option with the **highest average reward so far**, UCB adds a **confidence interval** (or bonus) to **encourage exploration** of less-tried arms.\n",

    "---\n",

    "## üìà UCB Formula\n",
    "\n",
    "For each arm $i$, at time $t$, the UCB value is calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{UCB}_i(t) = \\bar{x}_i + c \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{\\ln t}{n_i}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "\n",
    "* $\\bar{x}_i$ = average reward of arm $i$\n",
    "* $n_i$ = number of times arm $i$ has been pulled\n",
    "* $t$ = current time step (total number of rounds so far)\n",
    "* $c$ = constant to control exploration (commonly $c = \\sqrt{2}$)\n",
