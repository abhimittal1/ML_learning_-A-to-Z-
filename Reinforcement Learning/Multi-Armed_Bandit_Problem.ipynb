    "# üé∞ Mastering the Multi-Armed Bandit Problem in Reinforcement Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "## üß† What Is It?\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Multi-Armed Bandit Problem (MAB)** is a fundamental problem in **Reinforcement Learning**, where an agent must choose between multiple actions (slot machines) that offer **uncertain rewards**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine standing in front of several slot machines (also called ‚Äúone-armed bandits‚Äù) ‚Äî each with a different but **unknown payout rate**. Your goal is to **maximize your total reward** over time by figuring out **which machine pays out the most**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üéØ The Problem Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "* Each machine has a **different probability distribution** of reward.\n",
    "* The player (agent) **does not know** these distributions in advance.\n",
    "* The agent has to choose **which machine to play** at each step.\n",
    "* **Key Challenge**: Find the balance between:\n",

    "## üí° Real-World Analogy: Advertising Campaigns\n",
    "\n",
    "> A company like **Coca-Cola** wants to test multiple ad creatives.\n",
    "> Instead of A/B testing one-by-one (pure exploration), they:\n",
    ">\n",
    "> * Show all ads to users.\n",
    "> * Start giving more visibility to the better-performing ads.\n",
    "> * **Adapt in real-time**, making better use of the ad budget.\n",

    "This dynamic balance of **learning and earning** during the campaign is exactly what the multi-armed bandit problem models.\n",

    "## üìâ Understanding **Regret**\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Regret** = *How much reward you lose by not always choosing the best machine.*\n",
    "\n",
    "You can never completely avoid exploration, but your goal is to **minimize regret** over time by quickly finding and focusing on the best option.\n",

    "The Multi-Armed Bandit is often the **first step** in understanding **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**.\n",

    "In RL:\n",
    "\n",
    "* An **agent** interacts with an **environment**\n",
    "* Takes actions\n",
    "* Receives **rewards**\n",
    "* Learns from experience to improve future decisions\n",
    "\n",
    "The **multi-armed bandit** is a simplified RL problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "* No changing states\n",
    "* No long-term planning\n",
    "* Just one-step reward optimization\n",

    "* It tries different leg movements (actions).\n",
    "* Receives a reward if it walks, a penalty if it falls.\n",
    "* Over time, it **learns** how to walk ‚Äî just from rewards.\n",
