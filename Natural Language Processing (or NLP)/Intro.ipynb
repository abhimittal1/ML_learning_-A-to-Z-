    "\n",
    "### 🔍 Key Components of NLP:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Text Preprocessing** – Cleaning and preparing raw text (e.g., removing stopwords, stemming, lemmatization).\n",
    "2. **Tokenization** – Breaking down sentences into words or phrases (tokens).\n",
    "3. **Part-of-Speech Tagging** – Identifying grammatical roles (e.g., noun, verb).\n",
    "4. **Named Entity Recognition (NER)** – Detecting names of people, places, brands, etc.\n",
    "5. **Parsing** – Analyzing sentence structure (e.g., dependency trees).\n",
    "6. **Sentiment Analysis** – Determining sentiment (positive, negative, neutral).\n",
    "7. **Machine Translation** – Translating text between languages (e.g., English → French).\n",
    "8. **Text Summarization** – Condensing long text into key points.\n",
    "9. **Question Answering & Chatbots** – Understanding and responding to user questions.\n",
    "10. **Speech Recognition & Generation** – Converting speech to text and vice versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🛠️ Techniques Used:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Rule-based methods** – Using hand-crafted linguistic rules.\n",
    "* **Classical ML algorithms** – Naive Bayes, SVM, Decision Trees.\n",
    "* **Deep Learning & Transformers** – RNNs, LSTMs, and modern models like BERT, GPT.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📌 Real-World Applications:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Search engines (e.g., Google)\n",
    "* Virtual assistants (e.g., Siri, Alexa)\n",
    "* Language translation tools (e.g., Google Translate)\n",
    "* Spam filtering in emails\n",
    "* Sentiment analysis in social media monitoring\n",
