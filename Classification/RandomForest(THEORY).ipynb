    "# 🌲 Random Forest – Simple Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📘 What is Random Forest?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Random Forest** is an advanced **ensemble machine learning algorithm** that builds multiple **decision trees** and combines their results.\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s used for both:\n",
    "- **Classification** (e.g., Yes/No)\n",
    "- **Regression** (predicting numbers)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧠 How Does It Work?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It builds **many decision trees** (not just one).\n",
    "2. Each tree is trained on a **random subset** of the data.\n",
    "3. For **classification**, it takes the **majority vote**.\n",
    "4. For **regression**, it takes the **average prediction** from all trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "This \"forest\" of trees leads to **better accuracy and stability**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧪 Simple Example: Predict if a Loan Should Be Approved\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of one decision tree, Random Forest will:\n",
    "- Create multiple trees using different random parts of the data\n",
    "- Each tree makes a prediction: Yes or No\n",
    "- The forest takes the **majority vote** (e.g., 3 say Yes, 2 say No → final result = Yes)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ⚙️ Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Ensemble Learning**: Combining multiple models for better performance.\n",
    "- **Bootstrap Sampling**: Each tree gets a random sample of the data (with replacement).\n",
    "- **Feature Randomness**: Each tree also uses a random subset of features → makes trees different.\n",
    "- **Voting/Averaging**: Combines predictions from all trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ✅ Advantages of Random Forest\n",
    "\n",
    "- More **accurate** than a single decision tree.\n",
    "- Handles **missing values** and **imbalanced data** better.\n",
    "- Reduces **overfitting**.\n",
    "- Works for **both classification and regression** tasks.\n",
    "- **Scalable** and works well with large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ❌ Disadvantages\n",
    "\n",
    "- Slower than a single tree (more computation).\n",
    "- Less interpretable (hard to explain the result).\n",
    "- Can still overfit if the number of trees is too small or trees are too deep.\n",
