    "## How Neural Networks Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "### Two Approaches to Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Hardcoding\n",
    "- Tell program specific rules\n",
    "- Account for every possibility\n",
    "- Like driving with a map and road signs\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Neural Networks\n",
    "- Provide inputs and desired outputs\n",
    "- Let network figure out the process\n",
    "- Like a self-driving car\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Learning Process\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Concepts:\n",
    "- **Ŷ (Y-hat)**: Output value (what network predicts)\n",
    "- **Y**: Actual value (correct answer)\n",
    "- **Goal**: Make Ŷ as close to Y as possible\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Cost Function\n",
    "\n",
    "**Formula**: Cost = ½ × (Y - Ŷ)²\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose:**\n",
    "- **Measures error** in predictions\n",
    "- **Lower cost = better accuracy**\n",
    "- **Goal: Minimize cost function**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Cycle:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "1. Input data → 2. Get prediction (Ŷ) → 3. Compare with actual (Y) \n",
    "→ 4. Calculate cost → 5. Adjust weights → 6. Repeat\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: Student Grade Prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "**Inputs:**\n",
    "- Hours of study\n",
    "- Hours of sleep  \n",
    "- Mid-semester quiz result\n",
    "\n",
    "**Process:**\n",
    "1. Network predicts final exam score (Ŷ = 85%)\n",
    "2. Actual score is Y = 93%\n",
    "3. Cost = ½ × (93 - 85)² = 32\n",
    "4. Adjust weights to reduce this error\n",
    "5. Repeat until Ŷ ≈ Y\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scaling Up:\n",
    "- **Single student**: One small network\n",

    "\n",
    "Imagine weights plotted on a graph forming a U-shape. We want to find the lowest point (minimum cost).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Two Approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Brute Force Method\n",
    "- **Try every possible weight**\n",
    "- **Problem**: Takes too long for complex networks\n",
    "- **Time needed**: Longer than the universe has existed!\n",
    "- **Issue**: Curse of Dimensionality\n",

    "3. Move in direction of steepest descent\n",
    "4. Repeat until you reach the bottom\n",
    "```\n",

    "### Visual Analogy:\n",
    "Think of it like the old Prince of Persia video game - jumping from ledge to ledge, always going downward until you reach the checkpoint at the bottom.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Benefits:\n",
    "- **Efficient**: Skips many useless weights\n",
    "- **Fast**: Reaches optimal solution quickly\n",
    "- **Practical**: Works for complex networks\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitation:\n",
    "Works best when there's one clear minimum (global minimum). Sometimes might get stuck at a local minimum (not the absolute best solution).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Stochastic Gradient Descent\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Local vs Global Minimum Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem with Regular Gradient Descent:**\n",
    "- Might get stuck at **local minimum** (good, but not best solution)\n",
    "- Miss the **global minimum** (best possible solution)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solution: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)\n",
    "\n",

    "- **Updates weights after each observation**\n",
    "- **Random fluctuations**: Can escape local minimums\n",
    "- **Faster**: Lighter algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "### SGD Process:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "For each row of data:\n",
    "1. Run neural network\n",
    "2. Calculate cost\n",
    "3. Adjust weights\n",
    "4. Move to next row\n",
    "5. Repeat until all data processed\n",
    "```\n",

    "- **Balance between efficiency and stability**\n",
    "- **Most commonly used** in practice\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Use What:\n",

    "## Backpropagation\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Backpropagation?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Backpropagation** is the advanced algorithm that allows neural networks to adjust **all weights simultaneously** by working backwards through the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why is it Important?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Efficiency**: Updates many weights at once\n",
    "2. **Speed**: Makes neural networks practical\n",
    "3. **Accuracy**: Systematic approach to weight adjustment\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Process:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Forward → Calculate Error → Backward → Adjust Weights\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Detailed Steps:**\n",
    "1. **Forward Pass**: Data flows from input to output\n",
    "2. **Error Calculation**: Compare output with actual value\n",
    "3. **Backward Pass**: Error flows from output back to input\n",
    "4. **Weight Adjustment**: Update weights based on their contribution to error\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Principle:\n",
    "The algorithm determines **how much each weight contributed to the final error** and adjusts them proportionally.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analogy:\n",
    "Think of it like a company reviewing a failed project:\n",
    "1. **Identify the problem** (error calculation)\n",
    "2. **Trace back through all departments** (backward pass)\n",
    "3. **Determine each department's contribution to the failure**\n",
    "4. **Make appropriate changes** (weight adjustment)\n",

    "## Training Your Neural Network\n",
    "\n",
    "### Complete Step-by-Step Training Process:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 1: Initialize Weights\n",
    "- **Set weights to small random numbers** close to 0 (but not exactly 0)\n",
    "- **Why small?** Prevents any input from dominating initially\n",
    "- **Why not zero?** Neurons need some starting variation\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 2: Input First Observation\n",
    "- **Feed one complete data point** into the network\n",
    "- **One feature per input node**\n",
    "- **Example**: [Area: 2000, Bedrooms: 3, Distance: 5, Age: 10]\n",

    "#### Step 3: Forward Propagation\n",
    "- **Data flows left to right** through the network\n",
    "- **Each neuron processes inputs** with its activation function\n",
    "- **Produces output value** (Ŷ)\n",

    "#### Step 4: Calculate Error\n",
    "- **Compare output (Ŷ) with actual value (Y)**\n",
    "- **Measure the difference** using cost function\n",
    "- **Example**: If Ŷ = $250,000 and Y = $300,000, error = $50,000\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 5: Backpropagation\n",
    "- **Error flows right to left** through network\n",
    "- **Weights adjusted** based on their contribution to error\n",
    "- **Learning rate** determines how much to adjust weights\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 6: Repeat Process\n",
    "**Two options:**\n",
    "- **Reinforcement Learning**: Adjust weights after each observation\n",
    "- **Batch Learning**: Adjust weights after processing multiple observations\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 7: Complete Epochs\n",
    "- **One epoch** = entire training dataset processed once\n",
    "- **Multiple epochs** needed for good learning\n",
    "- **Monitor performance** to avoid overfitting\n",
    "\n",
    "### Training Strategies:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Learning Rate:\n",
    "- **Too high**: Network might overshoot optimal weights\n",
    "- **Too low**: Training takes very long\n",
    "- **Just right**: Steady improvement toward optimal solution\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Batch Sizes:\n",
    "- **Single observation**: Most random, can escape local minimums\n",
    "- **Full batch**: Most stable, but slower\n",
    "- **Mini-batch**: Good balance (common choice: 32-128 observations)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Number of Epochs:\n",
    "- **Too few**: Network doesn't learn enough (underfitting)\n",
    "- **Too many**: Network memorizes training data (overfitting)\n",
    "- **Monitor validation error** to find optimal stopping point\n",
    "\n",
    "### Success Indicators:\n",
    "1. **Decreasing cost function** over time\n",
    "2. **Good performance on validation data**\n",
    "3. **Stable learning** (not wildly fluctuating)\n",
    "4. **Reasonable training time**\n",
